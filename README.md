# Sample Android TV Channel App (TV Input) using TIF

This app is designed to show how to build live TV channel apps for
Android TV using the TV Input Framework (TIF). The sample is a service
that once installed, is recognized and run by the default TV app
(e.g. Live Channels app).

## Introduction

The sample app consists of a single TV input: 4 channels consisting of
MP4 videos, HLS stream and MPEG-DASH stream, organized into various
genres. The video files are served from Google Cloud Storage.
